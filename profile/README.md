# README

Welcome to our collective.

Repositories include the four [core processes](https://docs.prisma.events/patterns/Core%20Processes/). Additional repositories address auxiliary domains, such as the public website and our documentation site. 

Work is structured by github projects. Projects are created with a clear end-state in mind, defined prior or soon after project creation. Projects can be thought of as the container for all work (processes, structures, patterns) required for manifesting that end-state. An end-state is a whole-system state, which includes...

- Quality
- Function
- Scope/ system boundaries
- Dependencies
- Tests/ success criteria
- Task force (team members)

If you'd like to contribute, please familiarise yourself with the following resources first:

1. [Projects on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects)
2. [Prisma Docs](https://docs.prisma.events/)
3. [Prisma Telegram](https://t.me/+9-UF8k9H8dBjNWFk)
4. [Prisma Website](https://www.prisma.events)

Our work centres on transformation-oriented events. All software found in these repositories serves real-world contact in a living, ever-evolving, more-than-human world. Prisma's mission is to support/ amplify/ help-make-space-for agency among real-world communities that are, or want to be, on a multi-generational journey of growing ecological awareness. Those closest to the ground are our guides.
